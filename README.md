### Audience

[Back to top](<#table-of-contents>)

### Communication
 The website has a clear and bold design that makes it easy for visitors to access information. They are marked so users can easily navigate and find what they need without having to search extensively.
1. The website's sign-up form allows pet owners to submit their information and request pet care services before reading about the different types of services offered. This initial form of communication allows the pet-sitting service to understand the customer's needs and preferences before providing them with appropriate service options.
2. Throughout the process of arranging for pet care services, the pet owners and the pet sitting service can communicate with each other via email or phone to discuss details such as scheduling, pricing, and pet care instructions. This ensures effective communication and a smooth process for both parties.

It should be noted that the website provides information about the different types of services they offer, but the sign-up form is the main means of communication between the pet owner and the pet-sitting service.<br /><br />

## Design

### Wireframes

The wireframes for the project can be found [here.](/assets/readme-img/PawsomeCare%3AWireframe%3AProject1..pdf)

### Color Scheme
The color palette was created with the thought to provide as much simplicity as possible, without feeling overwhelming. Most of the color is primarily provided by the supporting images displayed across the site. However, text, headers, icons & backgrounds were generated in white, a subtle touch of satin sheen gold and peach. The combination of the two does not overwhelm the user.

### Typography
Poppins font style was selected for the main heading on each of the pages, accompanied by Source Sans 3. Sans Serif, if the mentioned fonts can't be loaded.<br /><br /> 
[Back to top](<#table-of-contents>)

### Imagery
The website features imagery, including the Hero video, that was sourced from free vector photo platforms. These images have been credited in the Credits section of the website. The purpose of using these images was to find the perfect introductory image that conveys to the user the purpose of the site. The images were sourced through a Google search to ensure their relevance and effectiveness in communicating the site's purpose.<br /><br />

# Bugs

## Fixed bugs
- The images in the testimonial section were not visible on the deployed website due to an issue with the CSS style sheet. The Slack Community help me discover that the image paths needed to be relative to properly display it.
- During the validation of the signup.html page, errors were triggered on the HTML validator.FORM element can't be nested. Before, I was attempting to set an action attribute for the thank you page to the button form within the sign-up form. However, I realized that I could place the action attribute to the first register form to resolve the issue.
- After the process of making my website responsive to small screens, I encountered an issue where horizontal scrolling caused a noticeable white space. This problem was traced to the margin of the image in the ethos section, which was responsible for the layout discrepancy. With the assistance and help of my educator, the issue was resolved by deleting it.

## Deployment

This project was deployed via GitHub Pages and the Gitpod browser, used as a development environment. From here I could commit and push my changes throughout the project.

Steps I took to deploy my website;

- Go to the repository for pawsome-care
