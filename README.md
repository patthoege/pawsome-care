## UX

### Site Purpose:
The purpose of Pawsome Care website is to provide a platform for pet owners to connect with local pet sitters to find a reliable and trustworthy person to take care of their pets while they are away.


### Site Goal:
The goal of the website is to simplify the process of finding a pet sitter and ensure that pet owners have peace of mind knowing that their pets are in good hands. Additionally, the website aims to help local pet sitters find new clients and grow their businesses.

### Audience:
The Pawsome Care website targets pet owners who are looking for trustworthy and reliable pet sitters to take care of their pets while they are away.  This audience includes individuals who may be going on vacation, busy professionals, frequent travelers, or anyone who needs assistance with pet care.

### Communication
 The website has a clear and bold design that makes it easy for visitors to access information. They are clearly marked so users can easily navigate and find what they need without having to search extensively.
1. The website's sign-up form allows pet owners to submit their information and request pet care services before reading about the different types of services offered. This initial form of communication allows the pet-sitting service to understand the customer's needs and preferences before providing them with appropriate service options.
  2. Throughout the process of arranging for pet care services, the pet owners and the pet sitting service can communicate with each other via email or phone to discuss details such as scheduling, pricing, and pet care instructions. This ensures effective communication and a smooth process for both parties.

It should be noted that the website provides information about the different types of services they offer, but the sign-up form is the main means of communication between the pet owner and the pet-sitting service.

### New User Goals
1. Easily navigate the site and clearly understand the information provided.
2. Be captivated by a visually striking design that captures their immediate interest and keeps them engaged on the site.

## Design

### Color Scheme
The color palette was created with the thought to provide as much simplicity as possible, without feeling overwhelming. Most of the color is primarily provided by the supporting images displayed across the site. However, text & backgrounds were generated in a white and subtle gradient light yellow. The combination of the two does not overwhelm the user.
An additional effect was used over the navigation bar and reserved only for the hover features over navigation and social links, to bring the user's immediate attention to the fact that there is something there to be clicked such as the menu items and the button in the hero section.

### Typography:
Poppins font style was selected for the main heading on each of the pages, accompanied by Source Sans 3. 

### Imagery:
The website features imagery, including the Hero video, that was sourced from free vector photo platforms. These images have been credited in the Credits section of the website. The purpose of using these images was to find the perfect introductory image that conveys to the user the purpose of the site. The images were sourced through a Google search to ensure their relevance and effectiveness in communicating the site's purpose.

## Features

### Navigation Bar
This is a CSS stylesheet for a website with a fixed header. The font family used is Poppins for the body and Source Sans 3 for the headings. The logo is floated to the left and the menu items are to the right. 

The hero section has a video and a text content box with a sign-up button. The animation zooms in on the video.

### Services
Below the hero section is a club ethos section, divided into two columns. The left-side is an image and on the right side is the list of services and its description.

The font size and color scheme are consistent throughout the website, with white text on a dark, transparent background. The color scheme is primarily black, white, and shades of yellow. There are hover effects on some elements, such as the menu items and the button in the hero section.
